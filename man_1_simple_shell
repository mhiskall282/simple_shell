.\" Manpage for Shell

.TH dash 1 "28 August 2019" "0.1" "mini-shell man page"

.SH NAME
    hsh - PepeGrillo Shell clone interface to the Unix system kernel

.SH SYNOPSIS
    $ [command] [-flags ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
     A Shell provides you with an interface to the system kernel.
          It gathers input from you and  executes  programs  based on
	       that input. When a program  finishes executing, it displays
	            that command's output followed by a new prompt.
		    .SH Compiling
		         gcc-4.8 -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
			 .SH Running
			     $ ./hsh
			     .SH PROMPT
			          The  prompt,  $,  which  is  called  the command prompt, is
				       issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can
				            type a command.
					         Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines
						      the command you want  executed by looking at the first word
						           of  your  input. A  word  is  an unbroken set of characters.
							        Spaces and tabs separate words.
